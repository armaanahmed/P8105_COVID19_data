### Regression analysis

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(modelr)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .6,
  out.width = "90%"
)
theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))
options(
  ggplot2.continuous.colour = "viridis",
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)
scale_colour_discrete = scale_colour_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d
```

```{r}
anxiety_df = read.csv("Indicators_of_Anxiety_or_Depression_Based_on_Reported_Frequency_of_Symptoms_During_Last_7_Days.csv") %>%  
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(indicator, group, subgroup, value) %>% 
  filter(indicator == "Symptoms of Anxiety Disorder or Depressive Disorder") %>% 
  filter(group == "By Age") %>% 
  group_by(subgroup) %>%
  mutate(row = row_number()) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = group,
    values_from = value
  ) %>% 
  rename(value = 'By Age') %>% 
  select(-row, -indicator)

anxiety_df
```

We will build a crude model first with predictors: age, education, sex, and race. State is not included because that would give us 50 extra variables. 
```{r plot}
anxiety_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = subgroup, y = value)) + geom_point()
```
